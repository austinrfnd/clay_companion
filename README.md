# Clay Companion

A portfolio platform for ceramic artists to showcase their work, manage their catalog, and connect with art enthusiasts.

## Project Overview

Clay Companion is a **Rails monolith** built with **Hotwire** for server-side rendering, designed to serve both a web application and a future mobile app API. The platform allows ceramic artists to create beautiful, gallery-like portfolios with minimal friction.

**Current Status**: Implementation Phase - Setting up foundation with Docker-first, TDD-first approach

- ✅ Artist authentication (email/password)
- ✅ Dashboard: Catalog, Series, Settings
- ✅ Public portfolio: Gallery, About, Process, Exhibitions, Press, Contact
- ✅ Image upload and management
- ✅ Series organization with groups
- ✅ Public/private/featured visibility controls
- ✅ Platform homepage with discovery

**Post-MVP** (Do NOT implement yet):

- ❌ Social sharing features
- ❌ Analytics dashboard
- ❌ Advanced search filters
- ❌ Email notifications
- ❌ Comments/feedback system

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Docker Desktop installed
- Git
- Code editor (VS Code recommended)

### Initial Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd clay_companion

# Build and start containers
docker-compose up -d

# Create database
docker-compose exec web bundle exec rails db:create db:migrate

# Run seeds (optional)
docker-compose exec web bundle exec rails db:seed

# Access application
open http://localhost:3000
```

See [DEVELOPMENT.md](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md) for detailed setup and workflow instructions.

### Authentication

Clay Companion uses **Devise** for authentication with the following features:

- **Email/Password Authentication**: Secure login and signup
- **Email Confirmation**: Required before account activation (24-hour token expiry)
- **Password Reset**: Secure password recovery via email (6-hour token expiry)
- **Remember Me**: Optional persistent sessions (2 weeks)
- **Profile Setup**: Required after email verification (profile photo, full name, location, bio)

**Custom Routes** (matching wireframe requirements):
- `/login` - Sign in page
- `/signup` - Registration page
- `/logout` - Sign out
- `/password/reset` - Request password reset
- `/email/verify/:token` - Email confirmation
- `/email/resend` - Resend confirmation email
- `/profile_setup` - Complete profile after verification

**Email Configuration**:
- Development: Emails are saved to `tmp/letter_opener/` (no SMTP needed)
- Production: Configure SMTP settings in `config/environments/production.rb`

**Testing Authentication**:
```bash
# Run authentication tests
docker-compose run --rm test bundle exec rspec spec/requests/artists/
docker-compose run --rm test bundle exec rspec spec/controllers/artists/
docker-compose run --rm test bundle exec rspec spec/features/authentication_flows_spec.rb
```

See [requirements/auth/auth-development-plan.md](requirements/auth/auth-development-plan.md) for complete authentication implementation details.

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
docker-compose run --rm test bundle exec rspec

# Run specific test file
docker-compose run --rm test bundle exec rspec spec/models/artist_spec.rb

# Run tests in watch mode
docker-compose exec web bundle exec guard
```

## Development Workflow

### Tailwind CSS

**Tailwind CSS is automatically built when the Docker container starts.** The `docker-compose.yml` is configured to run `bin/rails tailwindcss:build` before starting the Rails server, ensuring styles are always up-to-date.

If you make changes to Tailwind CSS files and need to rebuild manually:
```bash
docker-compose exec web bin/rails tailwindcss:build
```

This project follows **strict Test-Driven Development (TDD)**:

1. **Write failing unit/integration tests first** (use `test-driven-development` Claude skill)
2. **See tests fail** (Red)
3. **Write minimal implementation code** (Green)
4. **See tests pass**
5. **Refactor** if needed
6. **E2E tests** added after feature completion

See [DEVELOPMENT.md](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md) for detailed TDD workflow.

## Code Quality Standards

### Mandatory Requirements

**Documentation**
- ✅ Every file must have a header comment explaining its purpose
- ✅ Every public method must have a comment describing what it does
- ✅ Complex private methods should have comments
- ✅ Use YARD format for method documentation

**Internationalization (i18n)**
- ✅ NO hardcoded strings in views or controllers
- ✅ ALL user-facing text must be in `config/locales/*.yml`
- ✅ Use `t('key')` helper for translations
- ✅ Organize keys by namespace (e.g., `artworks.show.title`)

**HTML Test Attributes**
- ✅ ALL interactive elements must have `data-test-id` attributes
- ✅ Use format: `{resource}-{element}-{type}` (e.g., `artwork-submit-button`)
- ✅ Required for: form inputs, buttons, links, modals, navigation
- ✅ Makes tests resilient to CSS/i18n changes

**Ruby/Rails Best Practices**
- ✅ Follow Rails conventions strictly
- ✅ Use strong parameters in controllers
- ✅ Keep controllers thin (business logic in services/models)
- ✅ Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- ✅ DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- ✅ Avoid N+1 queries (use `includes`, `eager_load`)
- ✅ Use scopes for common queries
- ✅ Validate at model level
- ✅ Use database constraints for data integrity

**Testing**
- ✅ Write tests before implementation (TDD)
- ✅ Test happy path and edge cases
- ✅ Test validations, associations, and methods
- ✅ Use descriptive test names
- ✅ 90%+ code coverage goal

**Security**
- ✅ Never trust user input
- ✅ Use strong parameters
- ✅ Sanitize HTML output
- ✅ No SQL injection (use parameterized queries)
- ✅ No hardcoded credentials (use environment variables)

**Accessibility**
- ✅ WCAG AA compliance minimum
- ✅ Semantic HTML
- ✅ ARIA labels where needed
- ✅ Keyboard navigation support
- ✅ Focus indicators visible

See [CODE_QUALITY.md](docs/CODE_QUALITY.md) for complete standards and examples.

## Contributing

This is a solo project, but the requirements are structured for collaboration:

1. Read relevant requirement docs before implementing features
2. Follow TDD workflow strictly
3. Use exact design system values (colors, fonts, spacing)
4. Write tests for all new functionality
5. Ensure accessibility compliance
6. Document all code (YARD format)
7. Use i18n for all user-facing text
