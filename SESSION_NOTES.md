We were in the middle of **planning the UI for the MVP**. Specifically:

### âœ… Completed
1. **All Dashboard/Internal Pages** - FULLY PLANNED
   - Login page
   - Dashboard home (activity feed)
   - Catalog list (list view with cards)
   - Add/Edit artwork (left: images, right: form) - **Wireframe created**
   - Series management (separate pages for list and detail)
   - Portfolio settings (6 subsections: profile, exhibitions, press, studio, techniques)

2. **Started Public Portfolio Pages**
   - Homepage (Option C: Minimal/Editorial) - PLANNED

## How to Resume Tomorrow

### Step 1: Read These Files First
```bash
# Read these in order to get full context:
cat PROJECT_PLAN.md      # Overall project plan and tech stack
cat DECISIONS.md         # All decisions we've made
cat UI_PLAN.md          # UI planning (where we left off)
cat PROGRESS.md         # Current progress status
cat SESSION_NOTES.md    # This file
```

### Step 2: Tell Claude
Say something like:

> "I want to continue planning the Clay Companion UI. We left off after planning the homepage. Please read SESSION_NOTES.md, UI_PLAN.md, and DECISIONS.md, then continue planning the remaining public portfolio pages starting with the Gallery page."

Or simply:

> "Continue planning Clay Companion UI from where we left off"

### Step 3: Continue Planning
Claude should continue with:
1. **Gallery page** - Get decisions on layout, filtering, image modal
2. **About page** - Layout for bio, statement, photo
3. **Process/Studio page** - How to display behind-the-scenes photos
4. **Exhibitions page** - Past/upcoming shows layout
5. **Press page** - Media mentions layout
6. **Techniques page** - Educational content layout
7. **Contact page** - Display contact info

After all pages are planned, create wireframes for remaining pages.

### Public Pages

## What to Do After UI Planning

Once all UI pages are planned:

1. **Create remaining wireframes** for key pages
2. **Update DECISIONS.md** with any new UI decisions
3. **Commit all changes** to git
4. **Move to Phase 1**: Development setup
   - Initialize Next.js project
   - Set up Supabase
   - Install dependencies
   - Create basic layouts

## Notes for Claude

**Context Files to Read First**:
1. `SESSION_NOTES.md` (this file)
2. `UI_PLAN.md` (see what's been planned)
3. `DECISIONS.md` (see all decisions)
4. `PROGRESS.md` (see current status)

**Current Task**: Planning public portfolio pages, starting with Gallery page

**User Preferences So Far**:
- Prefers Option B/separate pages over tabs
- Likes minimal/editorial style (Option C for homepage)
- Wants list view with cards for catalogs
- Wants explicit wireframes when discussing layout

**Be sure to**:
- Update UI_PLAN.md as decisions are made
- Update DECISIONS.md with new decisions
- Create wireframes for complex pages
- Ask user for input on layout options
- Keep SESSION_NOTES.md updated at end of each session
