## 🚨 IMPORTANT ARCHITECTURE CHANGE

**MVP is now MULTI-ARTIST, not single artist!**

This is a significant change that affects the entire platform structure:
- Clay Companion is a platform hosting multiple ceramic artists
- Each artist gets: `claycompanion.com/artist-name`
- We now need a platform homepage at `claycompanion.com`
- Artists log in to manage their portfolios
- Public can browse/discover multiple artists

---

## Where We Left Off

We were **planning the Platform Homepage** (non-registered user homepage).

### ✅ Completed in This Session
1. **Artist Profile Page (Landing)** - FULLY PLANNED & FINALIZED
   - URL: `claycompanion.com/artist-name`
   - Layout: Minimal/editorial with enhanced content
   - Features: Featured artwork rotation (5-10 sec), artist statement, recent work grid (4-6 pieces)
   - Navigation: Fixed/sticky
   - Footer: Light grey with "Powered by Clay Companion" branding
   - **Wireframe created**: `wireframes/artist-profile.md`
   - All refinement questions answered and decisions documented

2. **Page Tree Structure** - CREATED
   - **File**: `PAGE_TREE.md`
   - Maps out complete site structure
   - Public portfolio pages (9 pages)
   - Dashboard pages (13+ pages)

### 🔄 Currently Planning
**Platform Homepage** (`claycompanion.com`) - Combining Options A + B:
- Option A: Artist Directory/Gallery (discovery-focused)
- Option B: Marketing Landing Page (platform promotion)
- Hybrid approach: Both discovery AND promotion

**Proposed sections**:
1. Hero + Platform Introduction
2. Featured Artists showcase
3. Value Proposition (For Art Lovers / For Artists)
4. Artist Directory / Browse
5. Footer

**Open questions** (need answers before continuing):
- A. Overall feel/vibe (marketing-heavy, art-first, or balanced?)
- B. Hero section visual (featured artwork, collage, minimal, or split?)
- C. Featured artists count (3, 4, or 6?)
- D. Value proposition section (keep, simplify, or skip?)
- E. Search/filter in MVP (search only, search+filters, or none?)

### ⏸️ Paused Planning
- **Gallery page**: Was in progress, paused to work on architecture/page structure
- **Remaining public pages**: About, Process, Exhibitions, Press, Techniques, Contact

### Step 2: Tell Claude
Say something like:

Or:

> "Let's continue with the Platform Homepage planning. I need to answer the open questions."

### Step 3: Complete Platform Homepage Planning
**Immediate next steps**:

2. **Create wireframe** for Platform Homepage based on decisions
3. **Update DECISIONS.md** with Platform Homepage decisions
4. **Update PAGE_TREE.md** with finalized platform homepage details

### Step 4: Then Continue With
1. **Artist Dashboard Home** - Revisit in context of multi-artist platform

## Notes for Claude (Next Session)

**Context Files to Read First** (in this order):
1. `SESSION_NOTES.md` (this file) - **READ THIS FIRST**
2. `PAGE_TREE.md` - NEW file, understand site structure
3. `DECISIONS.md` - All decisions (updated with multi-artist changes)
4. `UI_PLAN.md` - UI planning progress
5. `wireframes/artist-profile.md` - Completed wireframe example

**🚨 CRITICAL CONTEXT**:
- **MVP is now multi-artist platform** (major change from earlier planning)
- Platform homepage is NEW requirement (not previously planned)
- Artist Profile page is fully complete (good example for other pages)

**Current Task**:
- Complete Platform Homepage planning
- Need user answers to 5 open questions (see "Currently Planning" section above)
- Create wireframe after decisions made

**User Preferences So Far**:
- Prefers combined/hybrid approaches (e.g., Options A+B for platform homepage)
- Prefers Option B/separate pages over tabs
- Likes minimal/editorial style
- Wants list view with cards for catalogs
- Wants explicit wireframes when discussing layout
- Wants fixed/sticky navigation
- Prefers automatic features (rotation, slideshow)

**Workflow**:
1. Update UI_PLAN.md as decisions are made
2. Update DECISIONS.md with new decisions
3. Create wireframes for complex pages
4. Ask user for input on layout options
5. Update SESSION_NOTES.md at end of session
6. Update PROGRESS.md when major milestones complete

**Multi-Artist Implications**:
- Need to review PROJECT_PLAN.md for database schema updates (artist accounts, etc.)
- Dashboard pages may need multi-tenancy considerations
- Authentication flow might change
- May need admin/platform management features post-MVP
