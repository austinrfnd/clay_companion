# Clay Companion Project

## Overview

Clay Companion is a portfolio platform for ceramic artists to showcase their work, manage their catalog, and connect with art enthusiasts. This repository contains **complete tech-agnostic requirements** ready to be implemented in any programming language or framework.

## Project Status

**Current Phase**: Requirements Complete, Ready for Implementation

This is a **fresh start** - the previous Next.js/TypeScript implementation has been removed. All product planning, design decisions, and requirements have been preserved in tech-agnostic format in the `/requirements` folder.

## Requirements Folder Structure

All requirements are in `/requirements/`:

- **README.md** - Quick reference guide for all documentation
- **PRODUCT_OVERVIEW.md** - Product vision, goals, MVP scope (6,900+ words)
- **FEATURES.md** - Detailed feature specifications (8,200+ words)
- **USER_FLOWS.md** - User journeys and interaction patterns (6,800+ words)
- **DATA_MODEL.md** - Database schema and relationships (9,500+ words)
- **PAGE_STRUCTURE.md** - URLs, navigation, information architecture (6,300+ words)
- **DESIGN_SYSTEM.md** - Visual design specifications (10,500+ words)
- **MIGRATION_GUIDE.md** - Tech stack options and implementation roadmap (7,800+ words)
- **wireframes/** - UI mockups for all pages (10 wireframes)

**Total**: ~56,000 words of comprehensive documentation

## Finalized Design Decisions (Do Not Change)

These decisions are **finalized and tested** - implement exactly as specified:

### Colors
- **Primary**: Celadon Green `#6E9180` rgb(110, 145, 128)
- **Buttons**: Celadon Dark `#527563` rgb(82, 117, 99) - WCAG AA compliant (4.5:1)
- **Text**: Charcoal `#1F2421`, Slate `#5C6C62`
- **Backgrounds**: Misty White `#F8FAF9`, White `#FFFFFF`
- **Borders**: Pale Celadon `#A8C4B5`
- **Semantic**: Success `#0D8F68`, Error `#C73030`, Warning `#D68500`, Info `#2563EB`

### Typography
- **Font**: Inter (Google Fonts or self-hosted)
- **Weights**: 400 (Regular), 500 (Medium), 600 (Semibold), 700 (Bold)
- **Scale**: 12px, 14px, 16px, 18px, 20px, 24px, 30px, 36px, 48px

### Spacing
- **Base unit**: 4px
- **Scale**: 4px, 8px, 12px, 16px, 20px, 24px, 32px, 40px, 48px, 64px, 80px, 96px, 128px

### Icons
- **Library**: Lucide Icons (or equivalent like Heroicons, Phosphor)
- **Sizes**: 12px, 16px, 20px, 24px, 32px

### Accessibility
- **WCAG AA minimum** (4.5:1 contrast ratios for all interactive elements)
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- Focus indicators (2px Celadon Green outline)

## Flexible Choices (Your Decision)

Choose any:
- Programming language (Python, Ruby, PHP, Go, Rust, Elixir, Java, JavaScript, etc.)
- Framework (Django, Rails, Laravel, Phoenix, SvelteKit, etc.)
- Database (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, MongoDB, etc.)
- Hosting (Vercel, Heroku, Railway, Fly.io, AWS, etc.)
- CSS approach (Tailwind, Bootstrap, plain CSS, CSS-in-JS, etc.)

See `/requirements/MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` for 10 tech stack options analyzed with pros/cons.

## How to Work with This Project

### Before Implementing Any Feature:

1. **Read** the feature spec in `requirements/FEATURES.md`
2. **Check** the user flow in `requirements/USER_FLOWS.md`
3. **Review** the data model in `requirements/DATA_MODEL.md`
4. **Look at** the page structure in `requirements/PAGE_STRUCTURE.md`
5. **Reference** the design specs in `requirements/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`
6. **View** the wireframe in `requirements/wireframes/`

### Design System Implementation:

When styling components:
- Use exact color values from DESIGN_SYSTEM.md
- Follow Inter typography with specified weights and sizes
- Apply 4px spacing system consistently
- Use Lucide Icons (or equivalent)
- Maintain 4px border radius (SM) for cards, 8px (MD) for buttons/inputs
- Ensure all interactive elements meet WCAG AA contrast requirements

### Code Quality Standards:

- Write clean, readable code
- Follow framework conventions and best practices
- Include proper error handling
- Write tests for critical functionality
- Ensure mobile responsiveness
- Validate all user inputs
- Implement proper authentication and authorization

## MVP Scope

**Included in MVP**:
- Artist authentication (email/password)
- Dashboard: Catalog, Series, Settings
- Public portfolio: Gallery, About, Process, Exhibitions, Press, Contact
- Image upload and management
- Series organization with groups
- Public/private/featured visibility controls
- Platform homepage with discovery

**Post-MVP** (Do NOT implement yet):
- Techniques & Materials page
- Social sharing features
- Analytics dashboard
- Multi-artist collaboration
- Advanced search filters
- Email notifications
- Comments/feedback system

## Implementation Roadmap

Recommended 9-week implementation order:

1. **Week 1**: Setup & Foundation (project init, design system, database)
2. **Week 2**: Authentication (signup, login, sessions)
3. **Week 3**: Core Data Models (Artist Profile, Artworks, Series, Images)
4. **Week 4-5**: Dashboard UI (catalog, add/edit artwork, series management)
5. **Week 6-7**: Public Portfolio (artist landing, gallery, about, all pages)
6. **Week 8**: Polish & Testing (accessibility, mobile, performance)
7. **Week 9**: Deployment (hosting setup, production deploy)

See `/requirements/MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` for detailed phase breakdown.

## Important Notes

### Do's:
✅ Follow design system exactly (colors, fonts, spacing)
✅ Read requirements docs before implementing features
✅ Ensure WCAG AA accessibility
✅ Test mobile responsiveness
✅ Implement features in order: Auth → Data → Dashboard → Public Portfolio

### Don'ts:
❌ Don't change the Celadon Green color scheme
❌ Don't skip requirements documentation
❌ Don't add features not in MVP scope
❌ Don't ignore accessibility requirements
❌ Don't skip mobile testing

## Getting Help

If you need clarification on any requirement:
1. Check the relevant requirements document first
2. Look at the wireframe for visual context
3. Review the user flow for interaction patterns
4. Check MIGRATION_GUIDE.md for implementation tips

## Tech Stack Selection

Haven't chosen a tech stack yet? See `/requirements/MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` for:
- 10 tech stack options analyzed (Django, Rails, Laravel, Go, Rust, Phoenix, Spring Boot, SvelteKit, Astro, Remix/Nuxt)
- Decision framework based on your preferences
- Pros/cons for each option
- Implementation considerations

## Project Philosophy

**"Artwork-First"** - Design recedes into the background, letting ceramic artwork shine:
- Gallery-like minimalism
- Generous spacing (40px gallery gaps)
- Flat design with subtle borders
- Neutral Celadon Green palette
- Clean typography
- Accessible to all users
